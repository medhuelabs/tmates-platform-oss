## 1. Definitions

- **Software** – The tmates-platform-oss codebase, including any updates, patches,
  documentation, and related assets published by MedHue Labs LLC.
- **You / Your** – Any individual or legal entity exercising rights under this license.
- **Fair Use** – Use of the Software for personal projects, research, or within Your own
  organization without charging third parties or providing it as a managed/hosted service.
- **Commercial Offering** – Any product or service provided to third parties for a fee,
  subscription, or other commercial consideration, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),
  hosted APIs, managed deployments, or embedding substantial portions of the Software into
  proprietary offerings.

## 2. Grant of Rights

Subject to the conditions below, MedHue Labs LLC grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable right to:

1. Access, view, and study the Software’s source code.
2. Run the Software for personal, educational, or internal business purposes.
3. Modify the Software and create derivative works for Fair Use.
4. Share unmodified or modified copies of the Software within Your organization or with
   other individuals, provided that such sharing remains within Fair Use scope and includes
   this license text and copyright notice.

## 3. Fair Use Requirements

When using or modifying the Software under Fair Use, You must:

- Retain all license notices and attribution to MedHue Labs LLC.
- Clearly indicate any changes You make to the Software.
- Avoid misrepresenting Your version as an official MedHue Labs release.
- Not remove or obscure references to MedHue Labs, tmates, or the Tmates Fair Use License.

## 4. Restrictions on Commercial Offerings

You **may not**:

1. Provide the Software, or substantial portions of it, as a paid, hosted, or managed
   service to third parties.
2. Redistribute the Software (modified or unmodified) as part of a commercial product,
   marketplace, or platform offering.
3. Use the Software to replicate or compete directly with the tmates platform, tmates
   agents, or related MedHue Labs services.
4. Sell, rent, lease, or otherwise monetize access to the Software or any derivative work
   without a separate written commercial license from MedHue Labs LLC.

For clarity: self-hosting inside Your company, experimenting, or contributing patches is
allowed. Operating “tmates as a service” for customers, embedding it in a product You sell,
or monetizing it in any managed form requires a commercial agreement.

white-labeled services, redistribute the Software, or integrate it into commercial
offerings.

LLC may use, distribute, and relicense those contributions as part of the Software under
this license or future commercial licenses. You represent that You have the rights to grant
this permission and that Your contribution does not include third-party proprietary code.

tmates-platform-oss”) but may not imply MedHue Labs sponsorship or endorsement without
written permission.

## 8. Termination

This license automatically terminates if You breach its terms. Upon termination, You must
stop using and distributing the Software. Any Fair Use rights previously granted will be
reinstated if You cure the breach within 30 days, unless MedHue Labs LLC notifies You that
the breach is incurable. Termination does not affect MedHue Labs’ rights or remedies.
